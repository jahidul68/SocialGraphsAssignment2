    "#### **Plotting**\n",
    "For plotting, use bar plots (refer to week 2) use scatter plots (without connection lines). Use correct scaling - better to show differences in i.e. power laws\n",

    "Remember titles, axis labels, and labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the viz demonstrates your points\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison plots should be on the same plot (with the proper alpha transparency) setting, so they cannot conceal the data from us. Also use same binning, same axis (really good practice to have same ranges)\n",

    "Make plots readable and informative i.e. removing node labels of a network plot if they're not needed\n",

    "#### **Formatting**\n",

    "SUPER NICE To have:\n",
    "- References to support your theory\n",
    "- An outline of what your next code cell does in the markdown or sentence between your code cells that builds a logical flow within the notebook\n",

    "Super nice to remove:\n",
    "- The outputs for testing purpose\n",

    "\n",
    "*TA comments on Ass1:* Basically perfect hand-in with only a few very minor tweak we could have gotten 12/12. We got 2.75/3 on Part C (Simple network statistics: Country Musician Graph) because of: in and out degree histograms should have the same number of bins (if you compare them side by side). Also, for the exercise on connections we printed the top 5 total connections but we should have printed the top 5 for in-degree and the top 5 for out-degree seperatedly (the TA noted this was a very minor point).\n",
